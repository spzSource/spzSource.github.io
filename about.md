This blog is planned to be the place which gather note about dev stuff I faces during my work. Hope these notes will help not only for me, but for somebody else who interested in software development.

The main categories, that will be covered, are the following:

- .NET (.NET Core, ASP.NET Core, EF Core and so on.)
- Azure Cloud Platform;
- Architecture;
- Testing.

_Hope I will not forget about this blog after one week :)_
