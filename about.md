This blog is a place containing notes about development and design problems and approaches I meet as part of my work. I hope these notes will help not only for me, but for somebody else who interested in software development and design.

The main categories that are covered:

- .NET (.NET Core, ASP.NET Core, EF Core.)
- Azure Cloud Platform;
- Software Design;
- Testing.
