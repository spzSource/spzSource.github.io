## New certification

Microsoft recently has [announced](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375159) their role-based certification program. Six new job roles were announced: developer, architect, administrator, DevOps, Modern Desktop administrator, and enterprise administrator. But my interest will be aimed against azure developer role.

There are two exams:

- AZ-200 - Microsoft Azure Developer Core Solutions Exam;
- AZ-201 - Microsoft Azure Developer Advanced Solutions Exam;

Learning path for achieving certificate:
